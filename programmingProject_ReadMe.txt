1)Use the 'make' command to build and compile the buildLists.cpp and atkinson_finalProject_problem1.cpp programs. If make is not available the commands:

g++ -o buildLists buildLists.cpp
g++ -o final_project atkinson_finalProject_problem1.cpp

can be run seperately as their are no mutual dependencies.

2)Execute buildLists to generate the 9 datasets for the project. The datasets will be saved as .txt files in the same directory as the buildLists program.

3)Execute final_project to run the experiments described in the report. The output will be sent to STDOUT on the console but can be redirected into a text file. A sample of that text file has been attached along with the code for this project.
